This project contains a multi-DFE implementation of Transfer Entropy metric.

Transfer entropy is a non-parametric statistic measuring the amount of directed (time-asymmetric) transfer of information between two random processes. 
Transfer entropy from a process X to another process Y is the amount of uncertainty reduced in future values of Y by knowing the past values of X given 
past values of Y. The transfer entropy can be written as:

Transfer Entropy is able to distinguish effectively driving and responding elements and to detect asymmetry in the interaction of subsystems.
